1. Overview  
FwitIT is a new feature for the OpenBB Platform that enables high-risk, high-reward short-term investing through an AI-driven interface. The main objective is to use AI to bridge the gap between the risk for appetite and investment opportunities. The feature will have two primary functionalities:  

1. Swipe-2-Invest
   - The AI will crawl financial news sources available in OpenBB, as well as external sources like Redditâ€™s WallStreetBets and Twitter.  
   - It will generate short-term investment recommendations.  
   - Users can swipe right to invest or left to skip, like Tinder.

2. Bet-4-Me  
   - Users can input a strong belief about an upcoming event (e.g., "CPI will be much higher than expected").  
   - The AI will analyze the best short-term investment strategy to capitalize on this belief.  
   - The AI will automatically execute the trade if the user confirms.  

2. Goals & Objectives  
- Automate high-risk, short-term investing using AI-driven insights.  
- Leverage OpenBBâ€™s existing data sources to generate actionable investment ideas.  
- Provide a seamless, intuitive user experience with an easy to use interface.  
- Enable users to act on their market predictions with AI-optimized trades.
